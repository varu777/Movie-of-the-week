# Movie of the Week
Goal of this application is to become an open source movie tool that works similar to rotten tomatoes, imdb, etc. The tool's functionality is very limited at the moment, it only picks movies to watch for a one specific group. Decides which movie to watch from a pool of user inserted movies. Yet, it can be so much more. 

dev branch usually has the most up to date code.

If you'd like to start working on this, please reach out to Jason Cabrera at cabrerajason7@gmail.com . Check out the repo's issues to find something to work on.
